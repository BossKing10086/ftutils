title: Building and Installing the API Docs and Xcode Docset

---

Building the API Docs Yourself
------------------------------

The included [`Makefile`](http://github.com/neror/ftutils/blob/master/Makefile "Makefile at master from neror's ftutils - GitHub") makes building the API docs simple. To build the API docs you'll need [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ "Doxygen"). The [prebuilt binary](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc "Doxygen") for OS X works well, and it's the recommended installation method.

Once you have downloaded and installed Doxygen, ensure that the `doxygen` binary is on your path and run

{% highlight console %}
$ make docs
{% endhighlight %}
    
This will generate the docs and place them in `<PATH_TO_FTUTILS>/apidocs/html`

Building and Installing the Xcode Docset
----------------------------------------

Thanks to the magic of Doxygen, creating an Xcode docset from the API docs is very simple. Just run

{% highlight console %}
$ make docsetinstall
{% endhighlight %}

This will build the docs and the Xcode docset and create a symlink to the docset in `~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets`
    
This makes the documentation available and searchable in the Xcode documentation window. The regular HTML documentation will also be available in the same directory as before.
