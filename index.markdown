FTUtils iPhone Utility Code Library
-----------------------------------

The code in FTUtils is common utility code extracted from [Free Time Studios](http://www.freetimestudios.com/) iPhone projects. Currently, there is only one primary utility (`FTAnimation`) and some simple preprocessor macros. Some unit tests exist for the code, but more are needed.

Documentation, Examples, & Screecasts
-------------------------------------

The documentation is still under heavy development, and will be updated as pieces are finished. Keep an eye on the [gh-pages](http://github.com/neror/ftutils/tree/gh-pages "neror's ftutils at gh-pages - GitHub") branch of the github repository to see when it's updated. Some [basic examples](http://github.com/neror/ftutils/tree/master/Examples/ "Examples at master from neror's ftutils - GitHub") are already available, and the example code is also being updated regularly. Screencasts of the examples are also being created. Here is the first to wet your whistle.

A Note About the Generated API Docs
-----------------------------------

If you're viewing the API docs on [ftutils.com](http://ftutils.com/ "FTUtils") some of the links are broken. This is due to [a bug](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues#issue/107 "Issues - mojombo/jekyll - GitHub") in github pages that is supposed to be fixed soon. You'll have to [build the docs yourself](/docs/docset "Building the API Docs Yourself") to get around this.
